# C++ Curriculum

Welcome to the C++ Curriculum repository! This repository serves as a central hub for a series of C++ modules, each focusing on specific aspects of the language and its applications. Each module is designed to provide a comprehensive learning experience, covering fundamental concepts to advanced topics.

## Overview

The curriculum is structured into multiple modules, each addressing a key area of C++ programming.

## Modules

### [Module 00 - Introduction to C++](https://github.com/aelmaar/cpp-module-00)
- Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and other basic concepts.

### [Module 01 - Memory Allocation, Pointers, References, Switch Statement](https://github.com/aelmaar/cpp-module-01)
- Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, and the switch statement.

### [Module 02 - Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operator Overloading, Orthodox Canonical Class Form](https://github.com/aelmaar/cpp-module-02)
- Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, Orthodox Canonical class form, and fixed-point arithmetic.

### [Module 03 - Inheritance](https://github.com/aelmaar/cpp-module-03)
- Inheritance basics, types of inheritance, access specifiers, and polymorphism with virtual functions.

### [Module 04 - Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Interfaces](https://github.com/aelmaar/cpp-module-04)
- Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces.

### [Module 05 - Repetition and Exceptions](https://github.com/aelmaar/cpp-module-05)
- Repetition structures, exception handling.

### [Module 06 - Casts](https://github.com/aelmaar/cpp-module-06)
- C++ casting operators, implicit and explicit casting.

### [Module 07 - Templates](https://github.com/aelmaar/cpp-module-07)
- Template functions, template classes, template specialization.

### [Module 08 - Templated Containers, Iterators, Algorithms](https://github.com/aelmaar/cpp-module-08)
- Templated containers, iterators, and algorithms.

### [Module 09 - Advanced Container and Iterator Practice](https://github.com/aelmaar/cpp-module-09)
- Advanced practice with containers and iterators.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/aelmaar/CPP-MODULES
```
If you've already cloned the repository without submodules, you can initialize and update them using:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
2. Navigate into each module's directory to explore the detailed READMEs, examples, and exercises.
